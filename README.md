## Introduction

BubCNN is a bubble detection system which employs a pretrained Faster RCNN module to locate
bubbles and a pretrained shape regression CNN module to approximate the bubble shape by an
ellipse. It allows bubble detection without expert knowledge in digital image processing and
is applicable to a wide range of experimental setups.
If the results are not satisfying, use the transfer learning module to customize BubCNN to your 
images. Please share your transfer learning data to make future versions of BubCNN more general.
Program was tested for MATLAB 2019a. BubCNN requires the Deep Learning Toolbox. The transfer 
learning module requires the Deep Learning Toolbox and the Computer Vision Toolbox.
